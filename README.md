# HomeChef
**Project Description:**

    Home Chef is a web based application where home cooks can sell their goods to customers while
    sharing their recipes and building communities. Home Chef is targeted towards a wide range of
    customers. From the people looking for cheap homemade food, meal preps to food enthusiasts looking
    to purchase that specific dessert from their favourite home cook they found on Instagram.
    The domain of this project is E-commerce and social media. Home Chef will explore the food sector of
    online shopping by providing the users with a platform where they can buy/sell homemade food. It
    provides users with a social media platform where they can share and rate food recipes and interact with
    other users.

    The application is going to use flask(Python) for back-end development. MySQL will be used for
    managing the database. If needed React is going to be used for the front-end development.
